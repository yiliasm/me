            <p>
                Hi my name is Ilias Yeck and I am almost finished with my computer science degree.
                In the future I hope to be able to create some sort of app or work on developing a game.
                One of my biggest hobbies right now is golfing which is weird to me because I never thought
                that I would enjoy golf. I hope to become a lot better at it this year as it is one of the
                more relaxing sports to do. Anything that is outdoors I love doing and am excited for this
                summer to really start.
            </p>

            <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
            <p>
                This year I started my own roofing company and it has been going really well! We've been averaging
                2 roofs a week being put on, and it has been an amazing experience. I hope in the future that I can
                do this full time. I created my own website for the company a few months ago but after this class or
                maybe even as my project I want to refine it and recreate it in HTML. Originally I used Squarespace
                to create my website but I know if I used HTML it would work a lot better.
